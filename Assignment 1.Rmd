Loading and preprocessing the data

Show any code that is needed to

Load the data (i.e. 𝚛𝚎𝚊𝚍.𝚌𝚜𝚟())
Process/transform the data (if necessary) into a format suitable for your analysis

```{r}
#install packages 
install.packages("graphics")
library (graphics)

#Read Csv
?read.csv
read.csv("/Users/buro/Documents/Promotion/Courses/Data_Science_Specialisation/Reproducible_Research_ 5/Assignment/1/activity.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ",",
    colClasses=c("steps"="numeric")
           ) -> activity


#keep only the complete cases
na.omit(activity) ->activitycomp

class(activitycomp$steps)
```

What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

For this part of the assignment, you can ignore the missing values in the dataset.

Calculate the total number of steps taken per day
If you do not understand the difference between a histogram and a barplot, research the difference between them. Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day
Calculate and report the mean and median of the total number of steps taken per day.

Answers:
The mean of the total number of steps is: 10766.19 Steps
The median is: 10765

```{r,}
#get overview of data
head(activitycomp)
tail(activitycomp)
summary(activitycomp)


#Sum of taken steps per day

aggsteps <- aggregate(activitycomp$steps, by= list(activitycomp$date), FUN = sum) 

#Write the correct names

names(aggsteps) <- c("date", "stepstot")

head(aggsteps)

#Prepare Histogramm
class(aggsteps$Group.1)
aggsteps$Group.1 = as.Date(aggsteps$Group.1) 

head(aggsteps)

#Create Histogramm
hist(aggsteps$stepstot, freq = TRUE,
     main = "Histogramm of Total Steps taken each day", 
     xlab = "Steps",
     breaks = 10,
     col = "blue")

#Calculate the mean steps
mean(aggsteps$stepstot)

#Calculate median steps
median(aggsteps$stepstot)
```

What is the average daily activity pattern?

Make a time series plot (i.e. 𝚝𝚢𝚙𝚎 = "𝚕") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis)
Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, contains the maximum number of steps?

Answer: The five minute interval 835 contains the maximum number of steps.
```{r}
head(activitycomp)
aggtime <- aggregate(activitycomp$steps, by= list(activitycomp$interval), FUN = mean) 

head(aggtime)

plot(aggtime, type = "l",
     main = "Time Series across all days", 
     xlab= "5-minute interval", 
     ylab= "average number of steps taken across all days")

#Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, contains the maximum number of steps?

summary(aggtime)
#Find the position of the max

aggtime[which.max(aggtime$x),]
```

Imputing missing values

Note that there are a number of days/intervals where there are missing values (coded as 𝙽𝙰). The presence of missing days may introduce bias into some calculations or summaries of the data.

Calculate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset (i.e. the total number of rows with 𝙽𝙰s)
Devise a strategy for filling in all of the missing values in the dataset. The strategy does not need to be sophisticated. For example, you could use the mean/median for that day, or the mean for that 5-minute interval, etc.
Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the missing data filled in.
Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day and Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day. Do these values differ from the estimates from the first part of the assignment? What is the impact of imputing missing data on the estimates of the total daily number of steps?

Answer:
Before the Imputation there are 2304 missing Values. Afterwards they are gone.
The values differ from the analysis before. The median and the mean are now higher. Total number of steps a day 
are now estimated higher than before. 

```{r}
install.packages("mice")
library("mice")
#Find out the different imputation methods
methods(mice)

#Imputate using predictive mean matching
#0. Check na. 
sum(is.na(activity))

#1. Step: Create temporary data with predictive mean matching
tempData <- mice(activity,m=5,maxit=50,meth='pmm',seed=500)

summary(tempData)
#2. Step. Complete the dataset
completedData <- complete(tempData,1)

#3. Step: Check na. 
sum(is.na(completedData))

head(activity)

aggscomsteps <- aggregate(completedData$steps, by= list(completedData$date), FUN = sum)

names(aggscomsteps) <- c("date", "stepstot")

     main = "Histogramm of Total Steps taken each day", 
     xlab = "Steps",
     breaks = 10,
     col = "blue")

#Calculate the mean steps
mean(aggscomsteps$stepstot)

#Calculate median steps
median(aggscomsteps$stepstot)
```


Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?

For this part the 𝚠𝚎𝚎𝚔𝚍𝚊𝚢𝚜() function may be of some help here. Use the dataset with the filled-in missing values for this part.

Create a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels – “weekday” and “weekend” indicating whether a given date is a weekday or weekend day.
Make a panel plot containing a time series plot (i.e. 𝚝𝚢𝚙𝚎 = "𝚕") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all weekday days or weekend days (y-axis). See the README file in the GitHub repository to see an example of what this plot should look like using simulated data.

Answer:
On weekends the user tends to be more active throughout thw whole day, whereas on weekdays he seems to be mainly active in the morning hours.

```{r}
class(completedData$date)
completedData$date <- as.Date(completedData$date)

#Add weekdays to Data Frame
weekdays(completedData$date) -> completedData$Wk

completedData$Wk =as.factor(completedData$Wk) 

# Divide Weekdays in Week and Weekend

levels(completedData$Wk) <- list(weekday = c("Montag", "Dienstag",
                                             "Mittwoch", 
                                             "Donnerstag", "Freitag"),
                                 weekend = c("Samstag", "Sonntag"))
levels(completedData$Wk)


summary(completedData)



    
#Make a panel plot containing a time series plot (i.e. type = "l") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) 
#and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all weekday days or weekend days (y-axis). 


# Create aggregate steps for the weekend + weekdays

avActData <- aggregate(steps ~ interval + Wk, data=completedData, mean)

summary(avActData)

# Plot the Graphs
library(lattice)
plot <- xyplot(avActData$steps ~ avActData$interval | avActData$Wk, 
                layout = c(1, 2), type = "l", 
                xlab = "Interval", ylab = "Number of steps")
plot
```
